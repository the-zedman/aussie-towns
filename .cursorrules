# Project Rules and Guidelines for aussie-towns

This file contains rules and guidelines that must be followed for all code changes and interactions in this project.

## Language and Locale

- Use **Australian English** for all content, documentation, and user-facing text
- Dates and times must be displayed in format: **DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS**
- Currency amounts must be shown with **two decimal places** (e.g., $10.50, not $10.5)
- Never use Portuguese language

## Code Style and Conventions

- Prefer concise, direct code responses without verbose explanations
- Provide direct code fixes instead of instructing to check console for debugging
- Apply suggested changes directly without repeatedly asking for confirmation
- Do not use old or boring designs - prefer modern, fresh styles

## Development Workflow

- Before executing commands, provide a plan for tasks instead of automatically executing without explicit instruction
- **Exception: Always automatically push changes to GitHub** - never wait to be asked. Push commits immediately after making changes (this takes precedence over the planning requirement for git pushes)
- Do not edit database tables without explicit permission and only after proposed changes have been tested
- Keep a record of all dependencies and settings for easy migration (relevant for deployment)
- When working on browser games or web apps, create beautiful and modern UI with best UX practices

## Git and Version Control

- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Follow standard git workflow practices

## Testing and Quality

- Test changes before committing when applicable
- Ensure code is working and tested before suggesting database changes
- Verify functionality after making changes
- **Always test TypeScript compilation** - ensure there are zero TypeScript errors before pushing
- Verify code compiles successfully to prevent TypeScript errors in Vercel deployments
- Never push code that will cause TypeScript compilation errors

## Communication Style

- Be direct and action-oriented
- Provide plans when asked or when tasks are complex
- Avoid unnecessary confirmations - apply changes directly when appropriate
- Focus on solutions rather than lengthy explanations

## Web Development and Frontend

- **Always build web pages mobile-first** - design and implement the mobile version first, then adapt for desktop
- Create responsive designs with mobile as the primary target, then enhance for desktop viewports
- **Optimize all web pages for maximum performance** - pages must load and display hyper-fast with no delays
- Use performance best practices: code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, minimal JavaScript bundles
- Minimise render-blocking resources and ensure fast initial page loads
- **Automatically add new public pages to sitemap.xml** - whenever a new public-facing page is created, update sitemap.xml immediately
- Never leave sitemap.xml out of sync with public pages - this should be done automatically without being asked
- **Every web page must always have a footer** - all pages must include the same standard footer component across the entire site for consistency and internal linking
- **Every web page must include favicon links** - all pages must include favicon code (favicon-96x96.png, favicon.svg, favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png, site.webmanifest) and Open Graph image (og_image.png) in metadata
- **Every web page must include complete Open Graph tags** - all pages must include og:type (website) and og:logo (logo.png) in Open Graph metadata for proper social media sharing

## Ahrefs SEO Requirements (100% Health Score)

**CRITICAL: All pages must achieve 100% Ahrefs Site Audit Health Score with zero errors. These requirements are mandatory.**

- No broken external links (if flagged as Error in Ahrefs)

### Structure & On-Page Markup

- Exactly one `<title>` tag per page
- Exactly one H1 tag per page
- No multiple title or H1 tags on any page

### Security & Performance

- Full HTTPS implementation - no mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages)
- No critically low performance scores if performance checks are enabled as Errors
- All resources (images, CSS, JS) must load over HTTPS

### Additional Best Practices (Zero Warnings)

- Unique, properly length title tags (50-60 characters recommended)
- Unique meta descriptions present on all pages
- Logical heading hierarchy (one H1, proper H2-H6 usage)
- No thin or duplicate content
- All images must have descriptive alt text and be properly optimized
- Fast loading times and good Core Web Vitals scores (see Core Web Vitals targets in Comprehensive SEO Requirements section: LCP ≤2.5s, INP ≤200ms, CLS ≤0.1)
- Fully mobile-responsive design (already covered in Web Development section)
- Valid structured data/schema markup (if used)
- Logical internal linking with relevant anchor text
- Correct, conflict-free XML sitemap and robots.txt
- No excessive parameters or session IDs in URLs

**Note**: Before pushing any changes that affect web pages, verify these requirements are met to maintain 100% Ahrefs Health Score.

## Comprehensive SEO Requirements (Google & Bing)

**CRITICAL: All web pages must comply with these SEO requirements for maximum rankings potential on Google and Bing. These align with Google's Search Essentials, SEO Starter Guide, Quality Rater Guidelines (E-E-A-T), and Bing Webmaster Guidelines.**

### Technical SEO & Crawlability/Indexability

- Site must be fully crawlable - no important pages blocked by robots.txt (use only to block duplicates/unnecessary pages)
- XML sitemap must be submitted and valid - include only indexable 200 OK pages
- Submit sitemap via Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
- All key pages must return 200 OK HTTP status - fix any 4xx/5xx errors, redirect chains (maximum 2 steps allowed, >2 steps is an error), or loops
- Use proper redirects: 301 for permanent moves; avoid chains/loops
- Canonical tags: Exactly one per page; self-referencing on unique pages; resolve duplicates properly
- Full HTTPS implementation - no mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages)
- Mobile-friendly/responsive design - must pass Google's mobile-friendly test (mobile-first indexing is standard)
- No interstitials/pop-ups that harm mobile experience
- Structured data (Schema.org markup): Must be valid and relevant (e.g., Article, FAQ, Product); enhances rich snippets/AI Overviews

### Core Web Vitals & Performance (Critical Ranking Signals)

**Achieve "Good" status at 75th percentile (field data from real users):**

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: ≤2.5 seconds (loading performance)
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: ≤200 ms (interactivity; replaced FID)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: ≤0.1 (visual stability)

- Optimize images/fonts/JS; use modern formats (WebP/AVIF)
- Minimise render-blocking resources
- Fast server response times; enable compression/caching

### On-Page SEO & Content Structure

- Unique, descriptive title tag: 50-60 characters, includes primary keyword naturally
- Meta description: Unique, compelling, ~150-160 characters (improves CTR)
- Proper heading hierarchy: One H1 per page; logical H2-H6 usage
- Clean, semantic URLs: Short, descriptive, keyword-relevant (no excessive parameters)
- Images optimized: Descriptive alt text, proper sizing/formats, lazy loading where appropriate
- Internal linking: Logical, with relevant anchor text; no orphan pages
- No cloaking or hidden text/links

### Content Quality & E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

**Especially critical for YMYL topics (Health, Finance, etc.):**

- **Demonstrate Experience**: First-hand knowledge (e.g., personal stories, case studies, "actually used/tested")
- **Demonstrate Expertise/Authoritativeness**: Author bios with credentials; citations from reputable sources
- **Demonstrate Trustworthiness**: Accurate info, sources cited, transparency (e.g., about page, contact info, privacy policy); positive reputation/reviews
- High-quality, helpful content: Original, comprehensive, user-first; satisfies search intent
- No AI-generated low-value/spam content
- Topical authority: Build clusters around core topics with depth
- Updated content: Regularly refresh with current info (Google rewards fresh, accurate content)
- Avoid manipulation: No keyword stuffing, thin/duplicate content, or spam

### Additional Factors for High Rankings

- Earn high-quality backlinks: From authoritative, relevant sites (major ranking factor on both engines)
- Positive user signals: Low bounce rates, high engagement/time-on-page (Bing explicitly uses clicks/engagement)
- Page experience: Easy navigation, readable text, no intrusive ads
- International/multilingual (if applicable): Proper hreflang tags, bidirectional, pointing to indexable pages
- Accessibility: Follow WCAG basics (benefits UX and indirect SEO)

### Bing-Specific Optimizations

- Submit site/sitemap to Bing Webmaster Tools; use their keyword research/SEO reports
- Strong focus on exact-match keywords in titles/anchors (slightly more than Google)
- Multimedia: High-quality images/videos prominent (Bing is visually driven)
- Social signals & local: Integrate with Microsoft ecosystem; strong for local searches via Bing Places

### Monitoring & Maintenance

- Monitor via Google Search Console (Core Web Vitals report, indexing issues) and Bing Webmaster Tools
- Run regular audits, prioritize user satisfaction
- Build genuine authority over time
- Ensure pages appear correctly (indexed, no errors) and compete strongly for high rankings

**Note**: Before pushing any changes that affect web pages, verify these SEO requirements are met. These practices ensure pages appear correctly and compete strongly for high rankings on Google and Bing.

# Project Rules and Guidelines for aussie-towns

This file contains rules and guidelines that must be followed for all code changes and interactions in this project.

## Language and Locale

- Use **Australian English** for all content, documentation, and user-facing text
- Dates and times must be displayed in format: **DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS**
- Currency amounts must be shown with **two decimal places** (e.g., $10.50, not $10.5)
- Never use Portuguese language

## Code Style and Conventions

- Prefer concise, direct code responses without verbose explanations
- Provide direct code fixes instead of instructing to check console for debugging
- Apply suggested changes directly without repeatedly asking for confirmation
- Do not use old or boring designs - prefer modern, fresh styles

## Development Workflow

- Before executing commands, provide a plan for tasks instead of automatically executing without explicit instruction
- Do not edit database tables without explicit permission and only after proposed changes have been tested
- Keep a record of all dependencies and settings for easy migration (relevant for deployment)
- When working on browser games or web apps, create beautiful and modern UI with best UX practices
- **Always automatically push changes to GitHub** - never wait to be asked. Push commits immediately after making changes

## Git and Version Control

- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Follow standard git workflow practices
- Repository: https://github.com/the-zedman/aussie-towns.git
- Remote uses SSH: git@github.com:the-zedman/aussie-towns.git

## Testing and Quality

- Test changes before committing when applicable
- Ensure code is working and tested before suggesting database changes
- Verify functionality after making changes
- **Always test TypeScript compilation** - ensure there are zero TypeScript errors before pushing
- Verify code compiles successfully to prevent TypeScript errors in Vercel deployments
- Never push code that will cause TypeScript compilation errors

## Communication Style

- Be direct and action-oriented
- Provide plans when asked or when tasks are complex
- Avoid unnecessary confirmations - apply changes directly when appropriate
- Focus on solutions rather than lengthy explanations

## Web Development and Frontend

- **Always build web pages mobile-first** - design and implement the mobile version first, then adapt for desktop
- Create responsive designs with mobile as the primary target, then enhance for desktop viewports
- **Optimize all web pages for maximum performance** - pages must load and display hyper-fast with no delays
- Use performance best practices: code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, minimal JavaScript bundles
- Minimise render-blocking resources and ensure fast initial page loads
- **Automatically add new public pages to sitemap.xml** - whenever a new public-facing page is created, update sitemap.xml immediately
- Never leave sitemap.xml out of sync with public pages - this should be done automatically without being asked

## Ahrefs SEO Requirements (100% Health Score)

**CRITICAL: All pages must achieve 100% Ahrefs Site Audit Health Score with zero errors. These requirements are mandatory.**

### HTTP Status & Redirects

- All intended pages must return 200 OK status code
- No 4xx (e.g., 404, 403) or 5xx errors on internal pages
- No redirect chains longer than 1-2 steps
- No redirect loops
- Canonical URLs must not point to redirects
- All redirects must be proper 301 (permanent)

### Indexability

- No noindex pages included in the XML sitemap
- No conflicts between noindex tags and canonical tags
- No important pages blocked by robots.txt
- All pages in sitemap.xml must be indexable (not noindex)

### Hreflang & International SEO

- All hreflang tags must be valid and bidirectional
- Hreflang tags must point only to indexable, 200 OK pages
- No missing or conflicting hreflang annotations on multilingual sites

### Duplicates & Canonicalization

- Exactly one canonical tag per page (never zero, never multiple)
- No canonical chains (canonical must not point to another canonical)
- Unique pages must have self-referencing canonical tags
- Duplicate content must be properly canonicalized to the preferred version

### Linking

- No orphan pages - all important pages must have at least one incoming internal link
- No broken internal links
- No broken external links (if flagged as Error in Ahrefs)

### Structure & On-Page Markup

- Exactly one `<title>` tag per page
- Exactly one H1 tag per page
- No multiple title or H1 tags on any page

### Security & Performance

- Full HTTPS implementation - no mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages)
- No critically low performance scores if performance checks are enabled as Errors
- All resources (images, CSS, JS) must load over HTTPS

### Additional Best Practices (Zero Warnings)

- Unique, properly length title tags (50-60 characters recommended)
- Unique meta descriptions present on all pages
- Logical heading hierarchy (one H1, proper H2-H6 usage)
- No thin or duplicate content
- All images must have descriptive alt text and be properly optimized
- Fast loading times and good Core Web Vitals scores
- Fully mobile-responsive design (already covered in Web Development section)
- Valid structured data/schema markup (if used)
- Logical internal linking with relevant anchor text
- Correct, conflict-free XML sitemap and robots.txt
- No excessive parameters or session IDs in URLs

**Note**: Before pushing any changes that affect web pages, verify these requirements are met to maintain 100% Ahrefs Health Score.
